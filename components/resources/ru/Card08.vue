        <p>
          The first step in taking care of your mental health is keeping yourself informed and realizing that living with T1D can add significant stress to your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, people with T1D should follow the same physical and mental health self-care recommendations as the general population.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Stay informed about and practice healthy eating, but leave some room for treats every once in a while.</li>
          <li>Go to bed and wake up at regular hours.</li>
          <li>Do physical activity on a regular basis and aim for an ideal target of 150 minutes per week.</li>
          <li>Do relaxation activities, such as abdominal breathing and yoga.</li>
          <li>Seek social support (family, friends) and medical support (discuss stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, etc. during appointments) when going through tough times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Donâ€™t hesitate to discuss your mental health with your healthcare team if needed. It might be necessary, although difficult, to interrupt the regular flow of an appointment and seek help for a mental health issue. If needed, you can also consider getting help from a psychologist or psychiatrist.
